class GraphBuilder:
    """Build an NST Style Network as a Compuational Graph of Tensor Operations.

    Provides 3 methods for building the graph:
        - input
        - relu_conv_2d
        - avg_pool
    
    Client code must first call the 'input' method to provide the input image
    specifications (ie width, height, color_channels), which is necessary for
    the first layer of the Graph.

    Instances of this class are stateful, so the order in which the methods are
    called matters. The 'input' method must be called first, followed by
    alternating calls to 'relu_conv_2d' and 'avg_pool' methods.

    The Graph is stored in the 'graph' instance attribute, which is a dict of
    layer_id to the layer's output tensor.
