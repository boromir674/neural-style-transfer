        Computes the content cost

        Assumption 1: a layer l has been chosen from a (Deep) Neural Network
        trained on images, that should act as a style model.

        Then:
        1. a_C (3D volume) are the hidden layer activations in the chosen layer (l), when the C
        image is forward propagated (passed through) in the network.

        2. a_G (3D volume) are the hidden layer activations in the chosen layer (l), when the G
        image is forward propagated (passed through) in the network.

        3. The above activations are a n_H x n_W x n_C tensor
        OR Height x Width x Number_of_Channels

        Pseudo code for latex expression of the mathematical equation:

        J_content(C, G) = \\frac{1}{4 * n_H * n_W * n_C} * \\sum_{all entries} (a^(C) - a^(G))^2
        OR
        J_content(C, G) = sum_{for all entries} (a^(C) - a^(G))^2 / (4 * n_H * n_W * n_C)

        Note that n_H * n_W * n_C is part of the normalization term.
